# Housing-prices-prediction

So, imagine if house pricing was as easy as a house costs 50k + 50k per bedroom, so that a 1 bedroom house costs 100k, a 2 bedroom house costs 150k etc.
How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc
